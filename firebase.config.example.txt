# Firebase Configuration Example
# Replace the values in src/lib/firebase.ts with your actual Firebase project credentials
# Get these values from your Firebase Console: Project Settings > General > Your apps

Firebase Config Object:
{
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
}

Steps to get Firebase credentials:
1. Go to Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Go to Project Settings (gear icon)
4. Scroll down to "Your apps" section
5. Click "Add app" and select Web (</>)
6. Register your app and copy the config object
7. Paste the values into src/lib/firebase.ts

Firestore Setup:
1. In Firebase Console, go to Firestore Database
2. Click "Create database"
3. Start in production mode or test mode
4. Choose a location for your database
5. After creating the database, go to the "Rules" tab
6. Update the security rules to allow read/write access (for development):

rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}

7. Click "Publish" to save the rules
8. The "rooms" collection will be created automatically when you add your first room

⚠️ WARNING: These rules allow anyone to read/write to your database. 
This is fine for development but NOT for production.
